Regular expression (RegEx) matching is a method of searching, finding, and manipulating text based on patterns. It allows you to define a pattern, or a set of rules, and then search within a text for instances that match that pattern. This is useful for tasks such as:

- Validating input,
- Searching for specific strings or patterns within a larger body of text,
- Extracting specific information from text data.

 
# Objectives

In this project my job is to replicate the core functionality of the regex101 [website](regex101.com). This entails creating a web application that allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) and displays all the matches found.

🔗You can access the Regex matcher web app [here](http://3.84.231.245:5000/).

# Steps:

1. Create a new directory

2. Set up virtual development environment to install Flask, a Python web framework

3. Initialize a new Flask application

4. Create HTML templates

5. Define a route to handle form submission

6. Render the results

7. Test the application

8. Add-on: Implement a new route where a user can validate if a given email id is valid or not.

9. Deploy the application on AWS Cloud.
